## 🧠 Project Overview

Online payment fraud is a major challenge in digital transactions.  
In this project, machine learning models are trained to classify transactions as **fraudulent or legitimate** based on historical transaction data.

The solution demonstrates an **end-to-end ML pipeline**, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains transaction-level information such as:

| Feature | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Amount | Transaction amount |
| Transaction Type | Type of payment |
| Account Balance | Balance before transaction |
| Time-based Features | Transaction timing |
| Label | Fraud / Non-Fraud |

*(Dataset can be replaced with any real-world transaction dataset.)*
